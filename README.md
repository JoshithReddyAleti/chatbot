## 🚧 Problems We Ran Into & How We Overcame Them  

### **1️⃣ Handling Dynamic User Data**  
**Problem:** Ensuring that **transactions, bill payments, and income updates** were properly stored and retrieved dynamically.  
**Solution:** We implemented **local storage** to **persist financial data** across sessions and built an intuitive **dashboard that updates dynamically** whenever a user makes a transaction.  

### **2️⃣ Intelligent Chatbot for Finance Queries**  
**Problem:** Making the **chatbot understand multiple financial queries** and deliver **structured responses** was a challenge.  
**Solution:** We **enhanced natural language processing (NLP) logic** to recognize **financial terms** like "spending summary," "loan eligibility," and "investment recommendations," ensuring that the chatbot responds **intelligently to user queries**.  

### **3️⃣ Secure & Efficient Payment System**  
**Problem:** Creating a **functional and secure payment processing interface** while allowing **multiple banking actions (Pay, Transfer, Deposit, Invest)**.  
**Solution:** We **designed separate pages for transactions, transfers, and investments**, ensuring users have a clear step-by-step process for **securing financial transactions**.  

### **4️⃣ Data Visualization & UX Optimization**  
**Problem:** Representing financial trends **effectively** while maintaining a **clean, user-friendly UI**.  
**Solution:** We used **Chart.js** to provide **clear visual representations of spending habits, income vs. expenses, and investment trends**, making financial data more **digestible** for users.
